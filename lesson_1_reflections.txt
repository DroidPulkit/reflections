How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was really useful feature as it let me to veiw different changes in it
I was able to see + and - symbol in front of lines where
+ means that this line has been added and
- means that this line has been subtractes from this file
This is a cool feature . :)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having history makes me more likely god in programming as
I would be able to see the previous work which might have been good and now it is shitty or 
with it I can view the changes which i have made it too the new version It helps a lot

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

What I think is having manually saving has it's own pro's and con's
Pro's may be:
One can save or commit after a resoable logical change to the file
this way one doesn't have a big coomint nor small commit but a justified one
Con's may be:
Imagine we haven't saved the data and we made some important changes
now we lose it so auttomatically saving is also an good option

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows saving multile files in one commit cause they can be inter realted to each other like code in JS is 
used in HTML and CSS is linked too HTML too and in Google Docs each new file is treated seprately as
we don't code there we just write documents there which are unlikely to be inter realted

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log can be used to find all the commints and their respective messages
and with help of fit difff we can find differences between 2 commits by specifying their commit numbers

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

This makes me confident as I will be able to compare commits and be able to find the buggy code 
and help me to save millions of hours  finding bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I will use git to write codes for my sites and compare them
