What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a respository we see that it has created a new respository in the current directory
and we see it added .git to that directory.
We need to do this cause then only it will be called git respository or else it will be same as normal directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different as here we can preapare what files to commit together
